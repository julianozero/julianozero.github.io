# Game-Snake

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The game was developing in Javascript with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) framework.

## Gameplay

Use arrow keys to control your snake and eat the obstacles to grow. When you slither across the screen, you have to avoid the borders. Otherwise, the game will start again. Good luck =)
